Goal of this package is to provide a set of useful classes in order to use a JWT authentication with Guzzle.

**NOTE:** that this repository is still **WIP**

## Description

I will not proceed with creating classes that extend the `AuthenticatorInterface`. The AuthenticatorInterface
can be implemented by the developer who uses the package.

## Contributing

This repo is still WIP but feel free to comment on anything you might believe it's going wrong or even better contribute.
